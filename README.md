# DESIGNING THE SANDBOX LIMITATIONS
## A. PROTOTYPE
### LOADING/ONBOARDING
* HEY DEVICE, LISTEN FOR WHEN THE PLAYER PRESSES MY GAME'S ICON, ALERT MY GAME TO DO IT'S THING WHEN ; SHOW A SPLASH/LOADING SCREEN, BEGIN LOADING UI ASSETS, AND DISPLAY THE UI WHEN IT IS LOADED.

* the Device will listen for the player and instruct the Game to load when the player presses the game's icon;
// need `a game icon` -- [here's something for now](IMG_6072.png)

* the Game will load the user interface, but will display a splash/loading screen that will fade out when the user interface is done loading;
// need a `remedial user interface` that has `one design element conveying the the game's diving concept` and `three buttons: a "play" button, a "settings" button, and a joke button we'll call the "a third option" button` (maybe a link to an article about the ocean wanting you dead... [that didn't take long to find](https://www.cracked.com/article_21612_5-insane-things-deadliest-catch-leaves-out-about-my-job.html))
