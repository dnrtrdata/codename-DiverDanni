# PRIORITY/TASK CHECKLIST

## PRIORITY ONE - BASICALLY, THIS MEANS "WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT: `COMPONENT A` OR `COMPONENT B`"?
A. User-PlayerCharacter Interaction, which entails...
  - Interface/Controls [during gameplay; touch devices for prototype stage]
  - PlayerCharacter Visual Responsiveness [Animation Mostly; FX; Shading]
  - Haptics [
  - Feedback Audio
  - FX for PlayerCharacter motion
### HOW WILL YOU IMPLIMENT USER-PLAYERCHARACTER INTERACTION?
- *UserInterface/Controls [touch devices for prototype stage]*
  * *Controls: As a staple of the concept, I'll begin by mapping out the controls used in Epoch/Epoch 2:*
  1. `SWIPE-LEFT/SWIPE-RIGHT = move left/right between lanes [works both in/out of cover]`;
  2. `SWIPE-DOWN = take cover`;
  3. `SWIPE-UP = hang near top of screen`;
  4. 
    * *UI:
  - *PlayerCharacter Visual-Responsiveness [Animation Mostly;FX; Shading]*
  - Feedback Audio
  - Haptics
  - FX for PlayerCharacter motion

NTS: Expand on **]
