# PRIORITY/TASK CHECKLIST

## PRIORITY ONE - BASICALLY, THIS MEANS "WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT: `COMPONENT A` OR `COMPONENT B`"?
### User-PlayerCharacter Interaction, which entails...
  - Interface/Controls [during gameplay; touch devices for prototype stage]
  - PlayerCharacter Visual Responsiveness [Animation Mostly; FX; Shading]
  - Haptics
  - Feedback Audio
  - FX for PlayerCharacter motion
### HOW WILL YOU IMPLIMENT USER-PLAYERCHARACTER INTERACTION?
  - *UserInterface/Controls [touch devices for prototype stage]*
    * *Controls: As a staple of the concept, I'll begin by mapping out the controls used in Epoch/Epoch 2, which are* `SWIPE UP` = `hang near top of screen` 
    * *UI:
  - *PlayerCharacter Visual-Responsiveness [Animation Mostly;]*
  - Feedback Audio
  - Haptics
  - FX for PlayerCharacter motion
