# codename-DiverDanni

## the-pitch
Codename DiverDanni is a 3D, mobile-targeted, infinite-runner game set entirely undersea (infinite-diver then...got it) with a swipe control-scheme shamelessly stolen from brilliantly addicting (but sadly a bit outdated) cover-shooters [Epoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt3vcJmilqU) and [Epoch 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkD57QHmTTE) from [Uppercut Games](https://www.uppercut-games.com/).

I'm also drawing inspiration from the brilliant and beautifully-oversimplified character mechanics and environment creation in [Alto's Adventure](http://altosadventure.com/) and [Alto's Odyssey](http://www.altosodyssey.com/) by [Team Alto](http://www.altosadventure.com/team/)... specifically the one-touch jump/hold-to-backflip mechanic and the masterfully-composed layers of 2D sprites and increment weather. Who knows if I can acheive anything similar, but I'm going to try fleshing out the world's bg visuals with a similar aesthetic.

Female UserCharacter, mood/feel of isolation within--*and this can't be overstated*-the Pants-Shitting-Vastness (PSV) of the sea  Developing in Unity.

## leveraging-screen-space
I would like the visuals to be of the darker, moodier variety, similar to the visual-noise-driven light-rendering--and low-poly clever-animation-can-create-character-as-much-as-geometry--techniques used in **Playdead's Inside** (thoroughly outlined [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdN06E6Xn9E)

*Assuming a screen of **16x9 Units** (common ratio on mobile devices; units will probably = meters, but I'm an American and not yet ready to commit :/ )*
* The Gravity of--or Force exerted on--the User will start with...
  a. baseline speed = ~8-10 u/s
  b. hindered speed = ~7-8 u/s
  c. boosted speed = ~10-13 u/s
  
## approach-to-modules-and-PGC
This will need to be segmented due to the Assets I may be able to leverage into the process.

## Leveraging-the-Asset-Store
  I've jumped the gun on picking appropriate tools and purchased more Asset Store assets than is probably wise, but they've been having a big sale (ending in ~ 10 hours, I beleive)... so I decided I could justify going a little overboard. There are worse forms of Pandemic retail therapy (see? justifying it EASY).
  If not for use in free-diving game, then for educational use and future products. Anywho, here's a list of Assets I hope to use for this project (very broad; will narrow down with testing).

### Most-Comprehensive (Engines)
### 
* Low Poly Water - Builtin & URP - Poseidon 
> // appears simple to use; useful, **scaleable, tileable patterns**; mesh generation choice (plane, area, spline, custom) to **build overhead surfaces, add bg wave FX, and foam to User/Agent locomotion**; add ripples to large creature/structure events that make User feel small and insignificant (PSV).
